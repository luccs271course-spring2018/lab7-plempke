##What is the purpose of the various auxiliary methods populateList, populateFifoList, and ReverseLines.printReverse?

# Having these methods allows us to return and populate our lists recursively rather than using a while loop


##Why do these methods need to have arguments, and how does the argument change from one recursive call to the next?

# In order for it to be recursive it needs to call an object that it will be modifying for the given method


##What are the time and space complexity of each of the populateList populateFifoList methods, as well as ReverseLines.printReverse?

# all of the methods are 0(n)


##Which of these methods can be implemented using while loops?

# all of the recursion statements can be implemented using while loops
